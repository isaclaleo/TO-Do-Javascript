    Nest CSS with Sass
  </h1>
  <p>
    Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

article {
  height: 200px;
}

article p {
  color: white;
}

article ul {
  color: blue;
}
For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

article {
  height: 200px;

  p {
    color: white;
  }

  ul {
    color: blue;
  }
}

Use the nesting technique shown above to re-organize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should come before the p element.
  </p>
  <style type='text/scss'>
    .blog-post {
    h1 {
      text-align: center;
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    }
  </style>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h1>Blog Title</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
