    Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks with Partials
  </h1>
  <p>
    Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files.
    This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.

    Names for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to
    convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the .scss file extension. To bring the code in the partial
    into another Sass file, use the @import directive.

    For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss"
    file, this is how to use them in the main file:

    @import 'mixins'
    Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the import statement - Sass understands it is a
    partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to use.

    Write an @import statement to import a partial named _variables.scss into the main.scss file.
  </p>
  <!-- The main.scss file -->
  @import 'variables'
