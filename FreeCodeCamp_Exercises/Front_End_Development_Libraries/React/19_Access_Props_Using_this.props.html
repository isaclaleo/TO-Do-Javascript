  <h1>Access Props Using this.props</h1>
  <p>
    The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components. But what if the child
    component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? The
    ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

    Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class
    component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this. For example, if an ES6 class component has a
    prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

    Render an instance of the Welcome component in the parent component App. Here, give Welcome a prop of name and
    assign it a value of a string. Within the child, Welcome, access the name prop within the strong tags.
  </p>
  <script>
    class App extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

      }
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            { /* Change code below this line */}
            <Welcome name="isactes" />
            { /* Change code above this line */}
          </div>
        );
      }
    };

    class Welcome extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

      }
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            { /* Change code below this line */}
            <p>Hello, <strong>{this.props.name}</strong>!</p>
            { /* Change code above this line */}
          </div>
        );
      }
    };
  </script>
</body>
