  <h1>Use && for a More Concise Conditional</h1>
  <p>
    The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result.
    Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending
    on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may
    repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic
    in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some
    markup. Here's an example:

    <script>
      { condition && <p>markup</p> }
    </script>
    If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately
    return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your
    JSX
    and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex
    conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.

    Solve the previous example again, so the h1 only renders if display is true, but use the && logical operator instead
    of an if/else statement.

  <script>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          display: true
        }
        this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
      }
      toggleDisplay() {
        this.setState(state => ({
          display: !state.display
        }));
      }
      render() {
        // Change code below this line
        return (
          <div>
            <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
            {this.state.display && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}
          </div>
        );
      }
    };
  </script>
</body>
